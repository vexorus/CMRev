# CMRev — Context Menu Reversing

This program is a powerful tool and an excellent assistant for reverse engineering professionals. With its help, you can easily determine the bit depth and type of program without thinking about which decompiler to choose. It is enough to simply transfer the target file to CMRev through the context menu, and the program itself will determine which decompiler to launch (for example, IDA Pro or dnSpy).

Specify the paths to the executable files of the IDA, dnSpy and DIE decompilers. Then click the "Add" button. The program will save all parameters and will be added to the context menu.

You can delete a program at any time from the context menu by clicking the “Delete” button.
In order to test the work, right-click on the executable file and select CMRev from the context menu
